# 📚 VidyaSync – Streamlining Academic Success

VidyaSync is a centralized academic platform designed to simplify access to essential study materials, especially **Mid-Sem Test Papers**, which are often difficult to obtain through conventional platforms. It bridges the gap for students preparing for internal assessments and offers organized access to notes, syllabi, and important topics.

- Reduce dependency on seniors and faculty.
- Offer academic materials in a user-friendly and searchable format.
